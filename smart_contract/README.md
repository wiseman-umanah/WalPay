## WalPay Cadence package

This folder contains the `WalPay` Cadence contract and supporting transactions/scripts used by the frontend and backend to create, pay, and deactivate payment links on the Flow blockchain.

├── flow.json                           # Flow CLI configuration
└── emulator-account.pkey               # Local dev account keys (example)
```

## Prerequisites
- Flow CLI (`brew install flow-cli` or see Flow docs)
- Access to the platform treasury account that will receive fees (must expose `/public/flowTokenReceiver`)
- The same platform fee percentage used by the backend (`PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT`)

## Configure accounts
Update `flow.json` with your deployment and account keys:
```json
{
  "accounts": {
    "emulator-account": {
      "address": "f8d6e0586b0a20c7",
      "key": "..."
    },
    "platform-treasury": {
      "address": "01cf0e2f2f715450",
      "key": "..."
    }
  },
  "deployments": {
    "emulator": {
      "emulator-account": ["WalPay"]
    }
  }
}
```

The contract initializer takes two arguments:
1. `platformTreasury (Address)` – receives platform fees (FlowToken receiver capability must exist).
2. `platformFeeBps (UFix64)` – percentage fee (e.g. `2.0` for 2%). Keep this aligned with `PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT`.

## Running locally
```bash
# Start emulator and deploy
flow emulator start --http-port 8888 --rest-port 8889
flow project deploy --network emulator

# Run tests
flow test
```

## Useful commands
Create a payment (seller-signed):
```bash
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/create_payment.cdc \
  --args-json '[{"type":"String","value":"payment-123"},{"type":"UFix64","value":"10.0"}]' \
  --signer seller-account
```

Pay for a link:
```bash
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/pay.cdc \
  --args-json '[
    {"type":"String","value":"payment-123"},
    {"type":"UFix64","value":"10.2"},
    {"type":"Optional","value":{"type":"String","value":"order-456"}}
  ]' \
  --signer buyer-account
```

Deactivate a link:
```bash
flow transactions send cadence/transactions/deactivate_payment.cdc \
  --args-json '[{"type":"String","value":"payment-123"}]' \
  --signer seller-account
```

Read seller earnings:
```bash
flow scripts execute cadence/scripts/get_seller_earnings.cdc \
  --args-json '[{"type":"Address","value":"0xSellerAddress"}]'
```

## Integration notes
- The frontend wraps the transactions in `frontend/src/flow/walpay.ts`. Keep argument order/types consistent if you edit the contract.
- When redeploying to testnet or mainnet, update the addresses in the frontend `.env` (`VITE_WALPAY_ADDRESS`, `VITE_FLOW_TOKEN_ADDRESS`, etc.) and the backend configuration so fee calculations stay aligned.
- Emitted events: `PaymentCreated`, `PaymentPaid`, `PaymentDeactivated`. Hook listeners or indexers here for analytics/webhooks.
